  [33X[0;0YThe   GradientBasedLearningForCAP   package  is  a  computational  tool  for
  categorical   machine  learning  within  the  CAP  (Categories,  Algorithms,
  Programming)  framework.  It  provides  a  categorical foundation for neural
  networks   by  modelling  them  as  parametrised  morphisms  and  performing
  computation  in  the  category  of smooth maps. The system supports symbolic
  expressions and automatic differentiation via the lens pattern, enabling the
  bidirectional  data  flow  required  for  backpropagation. Included examples
  demonstrate  practical  applications  such  as  finding  a local minimum and
  training  models  for binary classification, multi-class classification, and
  linear  regression,  using  various  loss functions and optimizers including
  gradient  descent  and  Adam.  This  implementation  is  based  on the paper
